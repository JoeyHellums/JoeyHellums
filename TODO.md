General project ideas (feel free to make these if I don't)
  -a C++ library to check for words in a file (i.e only if by itsself, only if followed by this word, only if NOT followed by this word, etc)
  -a program to take a video file with subtitles and audio in a foreign language and turn it into an audio file with both the original audio and then the translated audo
